# Java-How-To-Program-11th-Ed

## Purpose
To get better at the Java Programming Language, I decided, about two years ago, to read all the chapters and solve most of the exercises from the book "Java How To Program 11th Edition" by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel. This repository keeps track of my daily practice.
